        Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in
        Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[14][15] and the deaths of six Indian personnel to friendly fire was later
        revealed: but the action had nationalist appeal.[16] Modi's party comfortably won the 2019 general election
        which followed.[17] In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, an
        Indian-administered portion of the disputed Kashmir region,[18][19] and introduced the Citizenship Amendment
        Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and
        killed by Hindu mobs,[20][21][22] sometimes with the complicity of police forces controlled by the Modi
        administration.[23][24] Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually
        causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which 4.7 million
        Indians died, according to the World Health Organization's estimates.[25][26]

        Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of democratic institutions,
        individual rights, and freedom of expression.[27][28][g] As prime minister, he has received consistently high
        approval ratings.[34][35][36] Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing
        politics. He remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally, over his Hindu nationalist beliefs
        and handling of the Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social
        agenda.[h]
